# CellularAutomatonVisual

Visualization of elementary cellular automata! 

A cellular automaton is a collection of "colored" cells on a grid of specified shape that evolves through a number of discrete time steps according to a set of rules based on the states of neighboring cells. The rules are then applied iteratively for as many time steps as desired.

In this project, I wanted to build a simple visualization of elementary CA to observe behavior as the automaton evolves through many generations. Certain automata (i.e. rule 30 or rule 45) have really interesting behavior, so this was a useful tool for me to see chaotic patterns emerge.

This project was made in conjunction with my project at the Wolfram Research high school summer program. See my post here: https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/1733073
